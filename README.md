#  Use a database with minimal API, Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core

Learned to add a database to a minimal API application with .NET 6 by using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

EF Core is an easy way to manage data in .NET applications. It's a lightweight, object-oriented, object-relational mapper that provides a high-level abstraction over the database. In this module, you used SQLite. You can also use other database providers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
